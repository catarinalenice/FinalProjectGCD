After downloading it, the training and test sets were merged into one data set. 
Then, only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted.
After that, the variables were named with proper labels, the same was made for the activities in the data set.
At last, a second and independent tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
